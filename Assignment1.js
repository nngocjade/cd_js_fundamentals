// Assignment 1 - Area of a circle
// Log the string "Area of a circle" to the console.
// Declare a variable called pi and assign the value 3.14 to it in one statement.
// Log the type of pi to the console.
// Declare a variable called radius and assign the value 5 to it in one statement.
// Log the type of radius to the console.
// Declare a variable called area which is calculated by pi and radius to get the area of a circle (the area of a circle is pi times the radius squared).

let pi = 3.14;
console.log(pi);

let radius = 5;
console.log(radius);

let area = pi * radius * radius;
console.log(area);
